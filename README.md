BUDGETY 
-------------------

The application allows you to add income and expenses, during a given month, each expense has a percentage of the total income.

The budgety calculates how much money you have earned and how much you have spent giving us a complete budget.

To remove or edit the elements, you must hover over them and the icons for each function are displayed.

The data is saved with `localStorage()` in the browser and you can print or save it as a pdf document via
 `Print()` function.

For this project, I wanted to use the module pattern, you can read more about it here [here](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-design-pattern-module-pattern-555737eccecd)

You can see how the app works [here](https://budgety.now.sh/) ðŸ‘ˆ
